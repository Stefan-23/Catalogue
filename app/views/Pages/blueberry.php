    Blueberries are perennial flowering plants with blue or purple–colored berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Vaccinium also includes cranberries, bilberries, huckleberries and Madeira blueberries. Commercial "blueberries" – including both wild ('lowbush') and cultivated ('highbush') blueberries – are all native to North America.
     The highbush blueberry varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.
